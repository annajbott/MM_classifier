# MM_classifier
Multiple myeloma (MM) whole bone marrow (WBM) niche cell type classifiers.
Generated using scRNA-seq data and scClassify.

Two relapsed MM patients.
Approx ~30,000 cells from WBM niche. Immune cells and MM cells. 
MM cells of training dataset identified using gene expression data and inferCNV.

Tested on publically available MM scRNA-seq data (GSE188632)	
(https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM5687372).
High agreement between MM cell assignment of classifier and user defined cell-assignments of clusters using gene expression data.
